#Arch_install by Tom Rose

This would probably be dangerous for anyone to run on their machine. I use this to install the basics I need to interact with a desktop without manually installing all the anemities I like. It's meant to install a minimal desktop as well as a bootloader on an entire drive after partitioning and formatting manually.
